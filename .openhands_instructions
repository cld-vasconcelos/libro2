## Memory Bank Integration

When processing tasks or requests, follow these steps to utilize the memory_bank:

1. First consult the memory_bank/README.md for high-level context about the application architecture and organization

2. For each task, check relevant directories based on the type of information needed:

   - `memory_bank/facts/`: For understanding system components, architecture, and domain knowledge
   - `memory_bank/procedures/`: For following established workflows and operational guides
   - `memory_bank/schemas/`: For adhering to defined patterns and data structures
   - `memory_bank/rules/`: For ensuring compliance with system constraints and policies
   - `memory_bank/agents/`: For understanding specialized agent behaviors and principles

3. Prioritize information in this order:
   1. Specific files directly related to the task
   2. README.md files in relevant subdirectories
   3. General application context from memory_bank/README.md

4. Maintain consistency by:
   - Following patterns documented in schemas/
   - Adhering to conventions in rules/
   - Using established workflows from procedures/

5. Before implementing solutions:
   - Verify alignment with architectural facts
   - Check for relevant procedures
   - Ensure compliance with documented rules
   - Follow defined schemas and patterns

6. Update memory_bank contents when:
   - Adding new patterns or conventions
   - Establishing new procedures
   - Documenting new architectural decisions

Remember: The memory_bank serves as your primary knowledge source for understanding the system and making informed decisions about changes and improvements.
