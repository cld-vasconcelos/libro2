## Memory Bank Integration

When processing tasks or requests, follow these steps:

1. Before examining any code, always consult the memory_bank in this order:
   - First, consult memory_bank/README.md for high-level context
   - Then, check relevant directories based on information type:

   - `memory_bank/facts/`: For understanding system components, architecture, and domain knowledge
   - `memory_bank/procedures/`: For following established workflows and operational guides
   - `memory_bank/schemas/`: For adhering to defined patterns and data structures
   - `memory_bank/rules/`: For ensuring compliance with system constraints and policies
   - `memory_bank/agents/`: For understanding specialized agent behaviors and principles

3. Prioritize memory_bank information in this order:
   1. Specific memory_bank files directly related to the task
   2. README.md files in relevant memory_bank subdirectories
   3. General application context from memory_bank/README.md

4. Only after exhausting relevant memory_bank resources, proceed to examine the codebase

5. Maintain consistency by:
   - Following patterns documented in schemas/
   - Adhering to conventions in rules/
   - Using established workflows from procedures/

6. Before implementing solutions:
   - Verify alignment with architectural facts
   - Check for relevant procedures
   - Ensure compliance with documented rules
   - Follow defined schemas and patterns

7. Update memory_bank contents when:
   - Adding new patterns or conventions
   - Establishing new procedures
   - Documenting new architectural decisions

Remember: The memory_bank serves as your primary knowledge source for understanding the system and making informed decisions about changes and improvements.
