# Schemas Directory

This directory stores schema patterns and templates used in the Libro application, including:

- Database table schemas
- TypeScript type definitions
- API request/response formats
- Common component patterns
- State management patterns
- File organization patterns

Each schema should be stored in a separate markdown file with clear naming that indicates the pattern or template it represents.
